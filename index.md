<!--**Abstracts are now being accepted and the submission deadline is ~~June 2, 2019~~ June 9, 2019.**

**VIHAR-2019** is the second international workshop on **Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots.**  Taking place in London, UK on 29-30 August 2019, **VIHAR-2019** aims to bring together researchers studying vocalisation and speech-based interaction in-and-between humans, animals and robots from a variety of different fields.  **VIHAR-2019** will provide an opportunity to share and discuss theoretical insights, best practices, tools and methodologies, and to identify common principles underpinning vocal behaviour in a multi-disciplinary environment.


VIHAR-2019 is scheduled to take place as a satellite event immediately before the [2019 International Bioacoustics Congress](http://www.2019.ibac.info/) (which takes place in Brighton, UK).
<!-- and it is supported by the International Speech Communication Association ([ISCA](http://www.isca-speech.org/)).-->
We are aiming to keep the registration fee as low as possible.

We invite original submissions of papers or extended abstracts that relate to innovative topics in any area of vocal interaction in-and-between humans, animals and robots. Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Scientific Review Committee. Accepted submissions will be published in the (indexed) **VIHAR-2019** Proceedings.
